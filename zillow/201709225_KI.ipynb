    "**Dealing with Missing Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first steps in building a good predictive model is to carefully handle missing values at the start. \n",
    "There's quite a lot of missing data in this dataset, so in this kernel I've illustrated various ways that we can impute missing values by carefully using the data we already have and I've outlined some key assumptions and rationale made in filling these missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think some of these approaches are better than filling in missing values with the medians for the fields (for example) or letting models deal with them in their default manner (xgboost for instance will have all the missing values as another category)\n",
    "\n",
    "After investigating the data in some detail there also appears to be some fields which represent similar if not the same information which I think we can probably be remove as they are redundant. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also potentially some inconsistent fields and potentially incorrect data that I discovered on the way and outlined this in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches use to deal with missing values also have to be made to the test data consistently - but I've not illustrated here in the interest of the kernel speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally after each step taken to deal with missing values you would probably want to carry out some cross-validation to see if it has helped improve your model - I haven't done this here but it would be interested to know if any of the adjustments do help improve the score so please comment if they do!\n",

    "Some additional points/caveats:\n",
    "- The K nearest neighbours function might not always be able to find a nearest value and by default it will categorise it into a seperate category. \n",
    "- The K value for nearest neighbours may not be optimal - I suggest it might be a good idea to use cross-validation to find the best k value. Also don't forgot to change fraction to 1 when you run this script (I have left it as 0.15 to prevent the kernel timing out)\n",
    "- As mentioned above, it would be reasonable to check that properties with missing values being predicted using knn are close to properties with missing values. Ie make sure your not predicting missing values using properties extremely far away in different cities/neighbourhoods etc\n",
    "- The adjustments above also have to be made to the test data, so potentially combined the train and test data and make the same adjustments\n",
    "- Prior to fitting models, categorical variables need to be one-hot encoded (there are some categorical features encoded as numbers and some tree-based methods may by default assume they are ordinal!). Probably a good idea to transform some of the skewed features aswell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a thought - I think we need to be very careful how we treat outliers that exist in test set. We are trying to predict errors in Zillows model. Potentially bigger errors are most likely to exist if there are outliers/errors in the data - for example, in the notebook above we spotted 2 claims where the area of the first floor is bigger than the area of the total property - probably a data error and these  two properties have errors which are larger than the average (Zillows model probably found it hard to predict them due to them being outliers/erros in data entry). But we want to be able predict these big errors and correcting these outliers I don't think will help. Likewise properties with missing values may be more difficult to predict by the Zillow model and therefore have big errors  - so filling in the missing values won't neccesarily help (which contradicts the purpose of this notebook! :) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Its probably worthwhile doing doing cross-validation work after making each change to understand if the changes help \n",
